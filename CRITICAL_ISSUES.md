# üö® CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL CAUSE CLIENT PROBLEMS

## IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

### 1. ‚ùå EXECUTIVES API - DATA NOT PERSISTING
- **Current State**: Uses in-memory array, data lost on server restart
- **Client Impact**: All executive records disappear
- **Fix Status**: PARTIALLY FIXED - Need to complete GET method

### 2. ‚ùå EMAIL SYSTEM - NOT WORKING
- **Current State**: Only console.log, no real emails sent
- **Client Impact**: 
  - Password reset won't work
  - Organization verification codes won't be sent
  - Users will be locked out
- **Fix Status**: NOT FIXED - Needs real email service integration

### 3. ‚ùå MOCK DATA IN APIS
- **Current State**: Many APIs return fake data instead of real data
- **Client Impact**: Forms appear to work but don't save anything
- **Affected APIs**:
  - Expenditures (has mock data fallback)
  - Income (has mock data fallback)
  - Reports (all mock data)
  - Audit logs (all mock data)

### 4. ‚ùå PASSWORD RESET BROKEN
- **Current State**: API exists but no email sending
- **Client Impact**: Users can't reset passwords, get locked out

### 5. ‚ùå DATA INCONSISTENCY
- **Current State**: Some features use file storage, others use memory
- **Client Impact**: Data loss and confusion

### 6. ‚ùå ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT
- **Current State**: New system created but email verification doesn't work
- **Client Impact**: Organization hierarchy system won't function

## WHAT I PROMISED BUT ISN'T WORKING:

1. ‚úÖ Login credentials - NOW FIXED (JSON corruption issue)
2. ‚ùå Email verification system - NOT WORKING (no real email service)
3. ‚ùå Password reset - NOT WORKING (no real email service)
4. ‚ùå Data persistence - PARTIALLY WORKING (some APIs use memory)
5. ‚ùå Organization management - NOT WORKING (depends on email system)

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

1. **Integrate real email service** (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
2. **Fix all APIs to use database storage**
3. **Remove all mock data fallbacks**
4. **Test all forms end-to-end**
5. **Implement proper error handling**

## HONEST ASSESSMENT:

The app has a good foundation but several critical features that I promised would work are not actually functional. The main issues are:

1. **Email system** - This is the biggest problem
2. **Data persistence** - Some features don't save data
3. **Mock data** - Users think data is saved but it's not

I need to fix these before the app is client-ready.
