# Authentication System Setup

## Overview
The authentication system has been completely rebuilt with proper security measures and error handling.

## Key Improvements

### Security
- ✅ Replaced SHA256 with bcrypt for password hashing (12 salt rounds)
- ✅ Added proper JWT token validation and error handling
- ✅ Implemented secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, SameSite, Secure)
- ✅ Added input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Email normalization and password strength requirements

### Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Client-side validation with real-time feedback
- ✅ Graceful fallback to memory storage when KV is unavailable

### Features
- ✅ User registration with password strength validation
- ✅ Secure login with proper credential verification
- ✅ Session management with JWT tokens
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Proper logout functionality
- ✅ Environment variable validation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   # Authentication (REQUIRED)
   AUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-change-this-in-production
   
   # Key-Value Storage (Optional - falls back to memory if not provided)
   KV_REST_API_URL=
   KV_REST_API_TOKEN=
   
   # Environment
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

## Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/me` - Update user organization info

### Error Codes
- `MISSING_FIELDS` - Required fields not provided
- `INVALID_EMAIL` - Invalid email format
- `WEAK_PASSWORD` - Password doesn't meet requirements
- `USER_EXISTS` - User already exists
- `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` - Wrong email/password
- `ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED` - Account is disabled
- `NOT_AUTHENTICATED` - No valid token
- `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` - Role-based access denied

## Security Features
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens are signed with HS256 algorithm
- Cookies are HttpOnly and SameSite=Lax
- Input validation on both client and server
- Email normalization (lowercase, trimmed)
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## Testing
1. Visit `/signup` to create a new account
2. Visit `/login` to sign in
3. Access protected routes like `/dashboard`
4. Test role-based access on organization creation pages

The system now provides a robust, secure authentication foundation for your application.
